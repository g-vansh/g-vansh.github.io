My name is Vansh. I am an incoming PhD student at [MIT's Sloan School of Management, in the Technological Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Strategic Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/academic-groups/ties/phd-program) program.

I am interested in applying my knowledge of innovation, econometrics, computer science, and biostatistics to study how and when people come up with ideas. Currently, I am exploring the effects of proximity on innovation and related policies. Recently, I have been curious about innovation's links to human evolution as well. My works-in-progress include research projects that study [the effectiveness of the GitHub Sponsors Program to improve innovation](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31668), and the [effectiveness of Brazilian municipal governments in mitigating the effects of regular flooding disasters](/publication/Diario-Municipal). I have research experience in development, innovation, education, healthcare, industrial organization, strategy, and urban economics. Please go to the [research](https://www.vansh-gupta.com/publications/) section to learn more about some of my research projects!

I researched the competitive effects of healthcare mergers in the US as an economic consultant at Charles River Associates. This involved a lot of experience in industrial organization, urban economics, and healthcare economics. I frequently corresponded with the U.S. Department of Justice and legal scholars to discuss the efficacy of legal frameworks that govern antitrust enforcement policies in the US for the healthcare industry.  

I like to apply what I have learned in classroom to solve real-world problems. I led pro-bono data-driven consulting projects in India and the USA, and was recognized as one of the [top 10 leaders in business consulting in India](https://www.ceoinsightsindia.com/magazines/leaders-in-business-consultants-june-2022/#page=42) by the [CEO Insights magazine](https://www.ceoinsightsindia.com/) in June 2022. 

Teaching is another excellent way of learning for me and I have greatly enjoyed and benefited from being an undergraduate [teaching assistant](https://www.vansh-gupta.com/teaching/) for various CS courses at Cornell.

Outside of academia, I am passionate about exploring cities & transit systems, and learning to bike hands-free.
