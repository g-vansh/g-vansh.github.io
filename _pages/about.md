My name is Vansh. I graduated from the [Dyson School of Applied Economics & Management](https://dyson.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. Additionally, passionate about statistics, machine learning, and causal inference, I pursued a double major in Biometry & Statistics at [Cornell's Bowers College of Computing & Information Science](https://cis.cornell.edu/), with [Research Honors in the Social Sciences](https://cals.cornell.edu/undergraduate-students/student-research/research-honors-program). Across my two majors, I concentrated in Computational Statistics & Data Management, Mathematical Statistics, and Analytics. At Cornell, I served as the Vice-President of [Cornell Business Analytics](https://www.cornellbusinessanalytics.com/) and conducted research with [Daniela Scur](https://www.danielascur.com/) and [Jorge Guzman](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/people/jorge-guzman), amongst others.

I am interested in applying my knowledge of innovation, econometrics, and computer science to study the effects of proximity on innovation and related policies. My current works-in-progress include research projects that study [the effectiveness of the GitHub Sponsors Program to improve innovation](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31668), and another which studies the [effectiveness of Brazilian municipal governments in mitigating the effects of regular flooding disasters](/publication/Diario-Municipal). I have research experience in development, innovation, education, healthcare, industrial organization, strategy, and urban economics. Please go to the [research](https://www.vansh-gupta.com/publications/) section to learn more about some of my research projects!

I have been researching the competitive effects of healthcare mergers in the US for the past 1.5 years. This involved a lot of experience in industrial economics, urban economics, and healthcare economics. I frequently correspond with the U.S. Department of Justice and legal scholars to discuss the efficacy of legal frameworks that govern antitrust enforecement policies in the US for the healthcare industry.  

I like to apply what I have learned in classroom to solve real-world problems. I led pro-bono data-driven consulting projects in India and the USA, and was recognized as one of the [top 10 leaders in business consulting in India](https://www.ceoinsightsindia.com/magazines/leaders-in-business-consultants-june-2022/#page=42) by the [CEO Insights magazine](https://www.ceoinsightsindia.com/) in June 2022. 

Teaching is another excellent way of learning for me and I have greatly enjoyed and benefited from being an undergraduate [teaching assistant](https://www.vansh-gupta.com/teaching/) for various CS courses at Cornell.

Outside of academia, I am passionate about exploring cities & transit systems, and learning to bike hands-free.
