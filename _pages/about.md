My name is Vansh, an undergraduate senior at the [Dyson School of Applied Economics & Management](https://dyson.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. Additionally, passionate about statistics, machine learning, and causal inference, I am pursuing a double major in Biometry & Statistics at [Cornell's Bowers College of Computing & Information Science](https://cis.cornell.edu/), with [Research Honors in the Social Sciences](https://cals.cornell.edu/undergraduate-students/student-research/research-honors-program). At Cornell, I serve as the Vice-President of [Cornell Business Analytics](https://www.cornellbusinessanalytics.com/) and conduct research with [Prof. Daniela Scur](https://www.danielascur.com/).

I am interested in applying my knowledge of strategy, econometrics, and computer science to study the interplay of firm resources in non-profit and developmental contexts. I have research experience in development economics, innovation, natural language processing (NLP), entrepreneurship, and strategy. Please go to the [research](vanshg.me/publications/) section to learn more about some of my research projects!

I like to apply what I have learned in classroom to solve real-world problems. I actively lead pro-bono data-driven consulting projects in India and the USA, and have been recognized as one of the [top 10 leaders in business consulting in India](https://www.ceoinsightsindia.com/magazines/leaders-in-business-consultants-june-2022/#page=42) by the [CEO Insights magazine](https://www.ceoinsightsindia.com/) in June 2022. 

Teaching is another excellent way of learning for me and I have greatly enjoyed and benefited from being an undergraduate [teaching assistant](vanshg.me/teaching/) for various CS courses at Cornell.

Outside of academia, I am passionate about studying and exploring cities & transit systems. Please do visit [this map](https://vanshg.me/portfolio/) for my to see all the cities I have been to!
