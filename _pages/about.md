My name is Vansh, an undergraduate senior at the [Dyson School of Applied Economics & Management](https://dyson.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. Additionally, passionate about statistics, machine learning, and causal inference, I am pursuing a double major in Biometry & Statistics at [Cornell's Bowers College of Computing & Information Science](https://cis.cornell.edu/), with [Research Honors in the Social Sciences](https://cals.cornell.edu/undergraduate-students/student-research/research-honors-program). At Cornell, I serve as the Vice-President of [Cornell Business Analytics](https://www.cornellbusinessanalytics.com/) and conduct research with [Prof. Daniela Scur](https://www.danielascur.com/).

I am interested in applying game theory, probability and optimization to study human behaviors and how strategic interactions between individuals can impact organizations and society as a whole. I have research experience in bounded rationality and human behavior modeling. Please go to [research](https://xinminglilyliu.github.io/publications/) section to learn more about some of my research projects!

I like to apply what I have learned in classroom to solve real-world problems and I interned at Blackston, Amazon Robotics and ODH, Inc. Teaching is another excellent way of learning. I have greatly enjoyed and benefited from being an undergraduate [teaching assistant](https://xinminglilyliu.github.io/teaching/) for various ORIE and CS courses at Cornell.

Outside of academia, I am an avid reader and please check out my [book rack](https://xinminglilyliu.github.io/portfolio/) for my favoriate books in decision making, game theory, behavioral economics and mathematical thinking.
