My name is Vansh, and I have been researching the competitive effects of healthcare mergers in the US for the past 1.5 years. This involved a lot of experience in industrial economics, urban economics, and healthcare economics. I frequently correspond with the U.S. Department of Justice and legal scholars to discuss the efficacy of legal frameworks that govern antitrust enforecement policies in the US for the healthcare industry.  

I graduated from the [Dyson School of Applied Economics & Management](https://dyson.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. Additionally, passionate about statistics, machine learning, and causal inference, I am pursued a double major in Biometry & Statistics at [Cornell's Bowers College of Computing & Information Science](https://cis.cornell.edu/), with [Research Honors in the Social Sciences](https://cals.cornell.edu/undergraduate-students/student-research/research-honors-program). At Cornell, I served as the Vice-President of [Cornell Business Analytics](https://www.cornellbusinessanalytics.com/) and conducted research with [Prof. Daniela Scur](https://www.danielascur.com/).

I am interested in applying my knowledge of strategy, econometrics, and computer science to study the interplay of firm resources in non-profit and developmental contexts. My current works-in-progress include research projects that study the effectiveness of the GitHub Sponsors Program to improve innovation, and another which studies the effectiveness of Brazilian municipal governments in mitigating the effects of regular flooding disasters. I have research experience in development, innovation, education, healthcare, industrial organization, strategy, and urban economics. Please go to the [research](http://vanshg.me/publications/) section to learn more about some of my research projects!

I like to apply what I have learned in classroom to solve real-world problems. I led pro-bono data-driven consulting projects in India and the USA, and was recognized as one of the [top 10 leaders in business consulting in India](https://www.ceoinsightsindia.com/magazines/leaders-in-business-consultants-june-2022/#page=42) by the [CEO Insights magazine](https://www.ceoinsightsindia.com/) in June 2022. 

Teaching is another excellent way of learning for me and I have greatly enjoyed and benefited from being an undergraduate [teaching assistant](http://vanshg.me/teaching/) for various CS courses at Cornell.

Outside of academia, I am passionate about exploring cities & transit systems, and learning to bike hands-free.
