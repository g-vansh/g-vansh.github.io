**I worked at the Labour Dynamics Institute at Cornell University, with Lars Vilhuber - the Data Editor for the American Economic Association.**

As a data reproducibility researcher, I was tasked to do the following for manuscripts submitted for review to the AEA Journals:
1. Web-scrape differently-structured ~5500 Brazilian municipality websites written in Portuguese, and download all the PDFs available (approximately 25 million PDFs).
2. The pipeline not only adapted to different website structures, but also evaded CAPTCHA issues using various techniques.
3. Using PDF plumber, I converted information from these differently structured PDFs into usefully structured Excel files.
4. Additionally, I did some geospatial data visualization in Python & Tableau to create interactive graphics for this project.
