This paper seeks to understand the effects of climate shocks on firms and labor markets in Brazil.

Under the guidance of [Daniela Scur](https://www.danielascur.com/), I worked to create a data pipeline from scratch that did the following:
1. Web-scrape differently-structured ~5500 Brazilian municipality websites written in Portuguese, and download all the PDFs available (approximately 25 million PDFs).
2. The pipeline not only adapted to different website structures, but also evaded CAPTCHA issues using various techniques.
3. Using PDF plumber, I converted information from these differently structured PDFs into usefully structured Excel files.
4. Additionally, I did some geospatial data visualization in Python & Tableau to create interactive graphics for this project.
