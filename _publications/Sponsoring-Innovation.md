This paper seeks to understand the effects of the introduction of GitHub Sponsorships on digital innovation. 

I worked on this project from the very beginning - contributing to the data pipeline, analysis, and the experimental setup. 
I worked under the guidance of [Jorge Guzman (Columbia Business School)](https://www.jorgeguzman.co/), [Maria Roche (Harvard Business School)](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1284955), and [Annamaria Conti (IE Business School)](https://sites.google.com/view/annamariaconti/home-page).

My responsibilities included:
1. Designing a data pipeline from scratch to create an unbalanced panel dataset of ~15000 GitHub users and thier repositories.
2. Executing the data pipeline in Python on a Unix environment, and processing the data into a panel using STATA.
3. Merging datasets collected using GraphQL and GitHub Archive, both of which had differing formats and structures.
4. Conducting preliminary data analysis in STATA, and contributing to experimental design as well.
