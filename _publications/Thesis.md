This dissertation seeks to understand the determinants of the competitive advantage generated by strategic choices at schools across the world. I look at data from the World Management Survey of ~1000 schools, and using the framework developed by [Jorge Guzman](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3915606), I analyze the value of the schools' resources in generating a competitive advantage based on students' performance in those schools.
