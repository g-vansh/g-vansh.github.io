## Innovation Growth Lab Research Network

I am a part of the **Innovation Growth Lab (IGL) Research Network**, an open community of researchers dedicated to advancing knowledge on science, innovation, and productivity through experimental research. This affiliation represents an exciting opportunity to engage with cutting-edge research methodologies and collaborate with leading researchers worldwide.

### Network Mission
The IGL Research Network's mission is to lower barriers to experimental research by creating opportunities and supporting the development of researchers interested in experimental approaches to studying innovation, science, and productivity.

### Research Focus
The network emphasizes:
- **Experimental research** in innovation and productivity
- **Evidence-based policy** development
- **Collaborative research** across institutions and borders
- **Methodological innovation** in studying complex economic phenomena

### Alignment with My Work
This affiliation complements my research on innovation economics, particularly my interest in understanding the causal mechanisms behind idea generation and the effectiveness of innovation policies.
