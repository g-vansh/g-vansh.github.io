## Innovation Growth Lab Research Network

I recently joined the **Innovation Growth Lab (IGL) Research Network**, an open community of researchers dedicated to advancing knowledge on science, innovation, and productivity through experimental research. This affiliation represents an exciting opportunity to engage with cutting-edge research methodologies and collaborate with leading researchers worldwide.

### Network Mission
The IGL Research Network's mission is to lower barriers to experimental research by creating opportunities and supporting the development of researchers interested in experimental approaches to studying innovation, science, and productivity.

### Research Focus
The network emphasizes:
- **Experimental research** in innovation and productivity
- **Evidence-based policy** development
- **Collaborative research** across institutions and borders
- **Methodological innovation** in studying complex economic phenomena

### Opportunities
Being part of this network provides access to:
- Cutting-edge experimental methodologies
- Collaborative research opportunities with international scholars
- Resources for conducting large-scale field experiments
- A community of researchers pushing the boundaries of innovation research

### Alignment with My Work
This affiliation perfectly complements my research on innovation economics, particularly my interest in understanding the causal mechanisms behind idea generation and the effectiveness of innovation policies.
