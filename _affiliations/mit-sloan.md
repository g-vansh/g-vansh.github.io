## MIT Sloan School of Management

I am currently pursuing my PhD at MIT's Sloan School of Management in the **Technological Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Strategic Management (TIES)** program.

### Program Focus
The TIES program at MIT Sloan integrates cutting-edge research in innovation economics with practical insights into how technology, entrepreneurship, and strategic management intersect to drive economic growth and societal impact.
