## MIT Sloan School of Management

I am currently pursuing my PhD at MIT's Sloan School of Management in the **Technological Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Strategic Management (TIES)** program. This world-renowned program focuses on developing principled, innovative leaders who improve the world through rigorous academic research and practical application.

### Program Focus
The TIES program at MIT Sloan integrates cutting-edge research in innovation economics with practical insights into how technology, entrepreneurship, and strategic management intersect to drive economic growth and societal impact.

### Research Environment
MIT Sloan provides an unparalleled research environment with access to:
- Leading faculty in innovation economics and strategic management
- Collaborative research opportunities across MIT's schools and departments
- State-of-the-art resources and data access
- A vibrant community of PhD scholars and researchers

### Mission Alignment
The school's mission resonates deeply with my research interests: "to develop principled, innovative leaders who improve the world and to generate ideas that advance management practice." This aligns perfectly with my work on understanding how proximity, genetics, and policy influence innovation and idea generation.
