Created an [open-source Python utility](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/Upload-to-Zenodo) for the American Economic Association's Data Replication team to synchronise their work across multiple databases - saving 40+ research assistants a lot of time. 

As a data reproducibility researcher, I worked under the AEA Data Editor, and took initiative on this project as a side-project.
